# OwlOS
An attempt to build an OS from scratch

## Plan
This is obviously going to be a long project. My plan is to complete it before the 7th semester of college. I'll be dividng this project into smaller projects starting from the bootloader for the OS.

# Tools
*Assembler*: NASM
*Virtualization*: QEMU
*IDE*: VSCode
